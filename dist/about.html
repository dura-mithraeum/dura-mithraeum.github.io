            <p> "Current representations available online of the Mithraeum are mostly in 2D, and many images of the Mithraeum do not seem to provide full context of the room, specifically in regards to what it might have looked like in different stages of excavation and construction. Our model aims to show different stages of excavation as well as different stages of construction with annotations about current research progress (e.g., pictures, transcriptions, modeling, and dating, etc.)."</p>
